********** Swapping: 
Unix system V was a pure swapping system.
used when RAM get filled completely. as CPU works with data in RAM only, RAM management is crucial. 
If single process need 100 mb and ram is of 64 mb only then it creates virtual memory. 
Swap space is already reserved space of disk by Kernel Memory manger to handle such cases. 
To swap a process means to move that entire process out of main memory and to the swap space
Entire process copies from main menory to swap device. For execution process is swapped from main memory to device.

It cannot handle the memory flexibly.
carries the disadvantage of a performance penalty, enefficient

********** Paging:
As swapping inefficient due to swapping all process in and out in one go, Paging comes into picture.
when active process requires more RAM, then only less recently used Pages are moved to swap space

It CAN handle the memory flexibly.
efficient

********** chmod
gv permissions to dir of file 
chmod 755 for 7 owner, 5 group, 5 public
read 4
write 2
execute 1
-R: recursively change the permission of file or directory

********** mount and unmount
generally needs sudo access
mount : mountss the storage into existing dir and users can access
unmount opp.

********** tee
send std input to std output
Redirects a copy of the input data to the specified file.
used while creating log fiels



**********know about the user information in UNIX
a) Id: displays the active user id with login and group.

b) Last: displays the last login of the user in the system.

c) Who: determines who is logged onto the system.




**********return values of kill() system call
0: process exits with given PID
-1: no process with PIC or not allowed to kill

kill -9 is used to forcefully terminate
kill -9 PID

ps -ef :see PIDs



**********‘system calls’ and ‘library functions’
System calls: signal sent from OS to kernel on behalf of user to perform tasks.

Library functions: The set of common functions that are not part of the kernel but is used by the application programs are known as ‘Library functions’.

********** wildcard interpretation
special kind of characters that represent one or more other characters. 
eg. Asterisk(*) means one or more characters
? : can be replaced with one character 

ls -ltr pras*txt
ls -ltr pras?txt

**********Alias

alias dir ‘Is –sFC’
When you simple type dir the fires the command


********** LINKS
soft links 
hard links




********** Blocks in UNIX
Each logical partitions in Unix are referred to as File system and each file system contains, a ‘boot block’, a ‘super block’,
Super block is created at the time of creation of file system, contains State of the file system, block size



********** Path names
Absolute Pathname: It defines a complete path specifying the location from root (/) dir


Relative Pathname: It defines the path from the current working directory where the user is


********** How is cmp command different from diff 
cmp’ command is basically used for byte by byte comparison of two files to determine the first mismatch byte. Displayes first mismatched byte position

diff’ command' determines the changes that are to be performed on the files in order to make the two files identical. 


********** Netwrking 
telnet 127.0.0.1 : remote login as well as for communication
ping 127.0.0.1:checking connection

netstat: it provides a lot of information like ongoing network connection on the local system and ports, routing tables, interfaces statistics, etc.

********** INODE

whenver file created inside a dir then it has 2 attributes: fie name and inde number Fie name mapped with Inode number.
Inode table is DS which stored info about each file:
Location on disk
size
acces privilages

********** Variables
A variable is defined as a character string to which a value is assigned
To define a shell variable, ‘set’ command is used.

To delete a shell variable, ‘unset’ command is used.



********** Kernel
3 parts of OS: Application, shell, kernel (heart)
does not deal with directly user.
Interacts with HW
File mgmt
Mem mgmt
Resource mgmt

********** Shell
3 parts of OS: Application, shell, kernel (heart)
Shell issues “$” as the command prompt
UNIX shell serves as an environment to run commands
For example: $date gives current date n time

types; C , bourne, korn, bourne again


********** 'nohup' in UNIX
“nohup” is a special command that is available to run a process in the background. The process started with ‘nohup' command is not terminating even the user started to log off from the system.
